Hi, my name is Acamaro Cutcher. I'm currently staying at a Hospice in Whidbey Island. I'm not about to die but rather have no other place to live. 
I have some funy stories,
The hospice nurse Jo, ask one of our pacients, Mary (not her whole name just so that personal records stay personal) if she was felling better. Mary aswered Well, I hope I'm doing better. Jo curiousy responded, well you know where your staying at right. Mary aswered, well yes, at a hospice. Jo pushing it a little continued, well you know what that means... Mary said, yes,they are waited for me to die. Jo asked Marry, who are they. Mary said You. haha Man did Jo dig up her on ditch to fall on. Well Jo still decided to continue, You know Mary you can talk to me about anything right. If you have any goals or anything else you want to speak about. Mary, aswered, Jo, I just want to watch this movie. Man, is that funny or what...

Yoo, shoulder pain is so dirturbing.
